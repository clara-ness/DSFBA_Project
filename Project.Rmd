# Introduction

# Data


## Analysis 
## Our research questions
```
1.Do European countries that have higher GDPs really have lower diabetes prevalence ?

```{r correlation, echo= FALSE}
cor(GDP_diabetes_test$avg_gdp,GDP_diabetes_test$prop_men_diabetes)
cor(GDP_diabetes_test$avg_gdp,GDP_diabetes_test$prop_women_diabetes)

```
We see a very small correlation. It would be interesting to push the analysis a bit further to see the representation in a graph. 

```{r plotGDP_diabetes_test, echo= FALSE}}
plot(GDP_diabetes_test$avg_gdp,GDP_diabetes_test$prop_men_diabetes)
plot(GDP_diabetes_test$avg_gdp,GDP_diabetes_test$prop_women_diabetes)
```


2.Do European countries that have higher GDPs consume less calories ?
```{r GDP_diabetes_test, echo= FALSE}}
cor(GDP_diabetes_test$avg_gdp, GDP_diabetes_test$total_consumption)
plot(GDP_diabetes_test$avg_gdp, GDP_diabetes_test$total_consumption)
```


3.How do the proportions of macronutrients (animal protein/plant protein/fat/carbohydrates) consumed differ between richer and poorer governments ?

4.And how do these differences relate to the diabetes prevalence in these countries ?

5.What is the typical diet that can be observed in richer states that relates to lower diabetes prevalence ?






## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
